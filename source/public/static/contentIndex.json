Each family provides a specific healthcare insurance. These families control the cost of the entire process or receiving care and treatment plans approved by the Medical Council. There are rumors of a conspiracy that they poison the public to ensure they rely on the system.\n\nPeople must reach out to each family in the Plutocracy and stay in their good graces, usually financially.\nIf a person does not have good standing with the family that they are seeking care or treatment from they will most likely be denied or charged the full price, which was set by that family.\nThe Plutocracy funds individual doctors and scientist and ensures these practices or labs will stay as medical malpractice tolerance zone, in hopes that they can provide new care/treatment plans for them.\nThese families compete against each other for care and treatment plans for who ever can get their process approved gets to set the price monopolize the insurance on it.\n\nSocial Hierarchy\nThe level of which magic and soft science is embraced is based at a community level.
